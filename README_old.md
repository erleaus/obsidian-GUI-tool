# 🤖 AI-Enhanced Obsidian Checker

Your Obsidian Checker now includes **FREE AI-powered semantic search** capabilities! This enables conceptual search that goes beyond simple keyword matching.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run with AI Features:
```bash
# 🖥️  Desktop App (macOS)
./launch_app.sh

# GUI with AI
./run_with_ai.sh obsidian_backlink_checker.py

# CLI with AI
./run_with_ai.sh obsidian_checker_cli.py --help

# Interactive Menu with AI
./run_with_ai.sh obsidian_menu.py
```

### Run without AI (original version):
```bash
# GUI without AI (shows AI info message)
python3 obsidian_backlink_checker.py

# CLI without AI (no AI options)
python3 obsidian_checker_cli.py --help
```

### Create Desktop App (macOS):
```bash
# Create a native macOS .app bundle
./create_desktop_app.sh

# Then double-click "Obsidian Checker.app" in Finder
# Or drag it to Applications folder
```

## 🧠 AI Features

### NEW: 🗣️ **Conversational AI (OpenAI Integration)**
Ask natural language questions about your vault:
```bash
# Interactive chat mode
python3 obsidian_checker_cli.py --chat

# Single questions with streaming
python3 obsidian_checker_cli.py --ask "Summarize all notes I have on climate change" --stream

# Get vault summary
python3 obsidian_checker_cli.py --vault-summary

# Suggest connections between notes
python3 obsidian_checker_cli.py --suggest-connections
```

**Example Interactions:**
- *"What are my thoughts on productivity?"* → Synthesizes content from all productivity notes
- *"Show me notes about machine learning"* → Finds and explains relevant content
- *"Summarize all notes I have on climate change"* → *"You have no notes on climate change"*

**Setup Required:** [See OpenAI Setup Guide](OPENAI_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for configuration

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### AI Not Available Message
If you see "AI search not available", make sure to:
1. Run with `./run_with_ai.sh` script
2. Virtual environment is properly activated
3. Dependencies are installed in the virtual environment

### Slow First Search
- First search builds the index automatically
- Subsequent searches are nearly instant
- Large vaults (1000+ notes) may take a few minutes initially

### Memory Issues
- AI features use ~100MB additional RAM
- Consider closing other applications during index building
- Index is cached, so building only happens once per vault

## 🎊 What's Next?

Your Obsidian Checker now has three powerful search modes:
1. **🔍 Text Search**: Fast keyword matching
2. **🤖 AI Search**: Concept understanding  
3. **🔗 Backlink Check**: Link validation

Perfect for turning your Obsidian vault into an intelligent knowledge discovery system!
