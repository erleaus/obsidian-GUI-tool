# 🎉 Obsidian Checker v1.0.0 - Major Release

**Release Date**: September 20, 2024  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Codename**: "DMG Professional"

## 🌟 What's New

This major release transforms Obsidian Checker into a professional, production-ready application with native macOS packaging and streamlined functionality.

### 📦 Professional macOS Distribution

**NEW: Complete DMG Packaging System**
- 🎁 **One-Click Installation**: Professional DMG installer with drag-to-Applications interface
- 📱 **Standalone App**: No Python installation required on target machines
- 💾 **Optimized Size**: Reduced from 500MB+ to ~160MB through dependency optimization
- 🔧 **macOS Native**: Proper app bundle with all system integrations
- ✅ **Compatible**: Works on macOS 10.13+ (High Sierra through latest)

### 🛠️ Build System Revolution

**Professional Build Pipeline**
- ⚡ **One-Command Build**: `./build_dmg_simple.sh` creates complete distribution package
- 🔄 **Automated Setup**: Handles dependencies, build environment, and cleanup automatically
- 📚 **Comprehensive Docs**: Complete build guide with troubleshooting in `DMG_BUILD_GUIDE.md`
- 🎯 **Reliable**: Clean, reproducible builds every time

### 🧹 Streamlined & Focused

**Codebase Optimization**
- 🎯 **Core Focus**: Removed experimental features to concentrate on essential functionality
- ⚡ **Faster Startup**: Eliminated heavy ML dependencies for quicker app launch
- 🔧 **Better Reliability**: Improved error handling and user feedback
- 💡 **Cleaner UI**: Simplified interface focusing on primary use cases

## 🚀 Key Features (Preserved & Enhanced)

### ✅ **Core Functionality** (Better Than Ever)
- **🔍 Backlink Analysis**: Find and fix broken links in your Obsidian vault
- **🔍 Advanced Search**: Fast text search across all notes with real-time results
- **🤖 AI Semantic Search**: Find conceptually related content (optional, with dependencies)
- **📄 Multiple Export Formats**: Markdown, HTML, Word with professional formatting
- **⚙️ Enhanced Settings**: Functional settings dialog with persistent preferences

### ✅ **What's Still Here**
- All the backlink checking and analysis features you know and love
- AI-powered semantic search (with `sentence-transformers`)
- Professional export options (Markdown, HTML, Word)
- Auto vault detection and validation
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux when run from source)

## 🗑️ What Was Removed (And Why)

### Experimental Summarization Features
**Why removed**: These were experimental features that:
- Required 2GB+ of additional dependencies (torch, transformers)
- Had stability issues with large texts
- Increased complexity and build times significantly
- Were not yet ready for production use

**Where they went**: Moved to `archived_features/` folder for potential future development

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Faster app startup and installation
- ✅ More reliable operation
- ✅ Smaller download size
- ✅ Focus on core strengths

## 📥 Download & Installation

### For Most Users (Recommended)
1. **Download**: `Obsidian_Checker_v1.0.0.dmg` from the releases section
2. **Install**: Double-click DMG, drag app to Applications folder
3. **Launch**: Open from Applications folder
4. **First Launch**: Right-click → "Open" if you get security warning (normal for unsigned apps)
