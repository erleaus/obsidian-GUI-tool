# AI Features Guide for Obsidian Checker

This guide covers all the AI-powered features available in the Obsidian Backlink Checker application.

## ü§ñ Overview

The Obsidian Checker now includes powerful AI capabilities that help you discover hidden connections, analyze content themes, and enhance your note-taking workflow. These features use state-of-the-art language models to understand the semantic meaning of your content.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **AI Concept Search**
Search for concepts and ideas rather than exact keywords.

**What it does:**
- Understands the meaning behind your search query
- Finds conceptually related content even if it doesn't contain your exact words
- Shows similarity scores for each result

**Example:** Search for "learning algorithms" and find notes about "neural networks" and "machine learning" even if they don't contain those exact words.

### 2. **Smart File Connections**
Discover potential connections between your notes.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes content similarity between all your notes
- Suggests which files might benefit from being linked
- Explains why files are related (shared themes, concepts)

**Use case:** Perfect for finding orphaned notes that should be connected to your main knowledge graph.

### 3. **Auto-Summarization**
Get an overview of your vault's main themes and content.

**What it does:**
- Identifies major themes across your entire vault
- Groups related content together
- Provides statistics about your knowledge base
- Shows which files belong to which themes

**Benefits:** Understand the structure of your knowledge and identify areas that need more development.

### 4. **Smart Tag Suggestions**
Generate relevant tags for your content automatically.

**What it does:**
- Analyzes individual files or your entire vault
- Suggests tags based on content themes
- Provides both content-based and context-aware tags
- Formats suggestions ready for Obsidian

**Options:**
- Analyze a specific file for targeted tag suggestions
- Analyze entire vault for global tag recommendations

### 5. **Find Similar Files**
Discover files with similar content to any given note.

**What it does:**
- Compares semantic similarity between files
- Shows percentage similarity scores
- Helps identify duplicate or overlapping content
- Suggests which files might be merged or cross-referenced

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### AI Model Selection
Choose from different AI models based on your needs:

- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (Default): Fast, lightweight, good general performance
- **all-mpnet-base-v2**: Higher quality embeddings, slightly slower
- **paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2**: Specialized for paraphrase detection

### Similarity Threshold
Adjust how strict the similarity matching should be:
- **Lower (0.1-0.3)**: More results, including loosely related content
- **Medium (0.3-0.5)**: Balanced results with good relevance
- **Higher (0.5-0.8)**: Fewer, highly relevant results only

### Performance Settings
- **Batch Processing**: Enable for better performance with large vaults
- **Max Results**: Control how many results to show (5-50)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the AI dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers numpy scikit-learn
```

### First Use
1. **Select your Obsidian vault** using the Browse button
2. **Build AI Index**: Click "üîÑ Build Index" to analyze your content
3. **Wait for processing**: First-time indexing may take a few minutes
4. **Start exploring**: Use any of the AI features once indexing is complete

### Index Management
- **Automatic Updates**: The index detects when your vault changes and rebuilds as needed
- **Manual Rebuild**: Click "üîÑ Build Index" to force a complete rebuild
- **Caching**: Index is saved automatically for faster subsequent launches

## üìã Step-by-Step Usage

### Using AI Concept Search
1. Enter a concept or idea in the "Concept:" field
2. Click "ü§ñ Concept Search"
3. Review results with similarity scores
4. Click on results to explore related content

### Finding Smart Connections  
1. Click "üîó Smart Connections"
2. Review suggested file relationships
3. Consider adding links between highly similar files
4. Use the explanations to understand why files are related

### Auto-Summarizing Content
1. Click "üìù Auto-Summarize"  
2. Review identified themes and file groupings
3. Examine vault statistics
4. Use insights to organize your knowledge better

### Getting Tag Suggestions
1. Click "üè∑Ô∏è Suggest Tags"
2. Choose to analyze a specific file or entire vault
3. Review suggested tags
4. Copy and paste tag suggestions into your notes

### Finding Similar Files
1. Click "üîç Find Similar"
2. Enter the path to a file you want to compare
3. Review similar files with similarity percentages
4. Consider merging or linking highly similar content

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### For Better Results
- **Keep notes focused**: Individual notes with clear topics work best
- **Use descriptive content**: Rich, descriptive text helps AI understand context
- **Regular indexing**: Rebuild the index periodically as your vault grows

### Performance Optimization
- **Enable batch processing** for vaults with 100+ files
- **Adjust similarity threshold** based on your vault size and content density
- **Limit max results** for faster processing with large vaults

### Content Organization
- Use **Auto-Summarization** to understand your vault's structure
- Apply **Smart Tag Suggestions** consistently across related content
- Follow **Smart Connections** recommendations to improve your knowledge graph

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI features not available:**
- Ensure AI dependencies are installed: `pip install sentence-transformers numpy scikit-learn`
- Restart the application after installing dependencies

**Slow performance:**
- Enable batch processing in settings
- Reduce max results if you don't need many
- Consider using the faster "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model

**No results found:**
- Lower the similarity threshold
- Check that your vault has been indexed
- Ensure your search terms are descriptive

**Index building fails:**
- Check that vault path is correct and accessible
- Ensure you have write permissions to the vault directory
- Try rebuilding the index manually

**Memory issues:**
- Enable batch processing for large vaults
- Close other applications while building index
- Consider processing your vault in smaller sections

### Performance Guidelines

| Vault Size | Expected Index Time | Memory Usage |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| < 50 files | 10-30 seconds | < 50MB |
| 50-200 files | 1-3 minutes | 50-200MB |  
| 200-500 files | 3-10 minutes | 200-500MB |
| 500+ files | 10+ minutes | 500MB+ |

## üìä Understanding Results

### Similarity Scores
- **0.8-1.0**: Extremely similar content (possible duplicates)
- **0.6-0.8**: Highly related content (strong connection recommended)
- **0.4-0.6**: Moderately related content (may be worth linking)
- **0.2-0.4**: Loosely related content (consider for broader themes)
- **< 0.2**: Minimally related content

### Theme Analysis
Auto-summarization groups content into themes based on:
- Shared vocabulary and concepts
- Semantic similarity
- Content structure and organization
- Cross-references and links

## üìà Advanced Usage
