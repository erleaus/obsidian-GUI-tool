                Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks.
                They consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process information.
                
                These systems learn through training on large datasets, adjusting connection
                weights to minimize prediction errors. Deep learning uses multiple hidden
                layers to model complex patterns in data.
                
                Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and
                autonomous systems. The field continues to evolve rapidly with new
                architectures and training methods.
