# 🔀 Git Workflow Guide - Publishing v1.0.0

This guide walks you through pushing all changes to GitHub and properly merging branches for the v1.0.0 release.

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ **Current Branch**: `desktop-launcher-testing`
- ✅ **Changes Committed**: All v1.0.0 features committed locally
- ✅ **Files Added**: DMG build system, documentation, archived features
- ✅ **Ready to Push**: Local repository is ready for GitHub publication

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Push Current Branch to GitHub

```bash
# Push the desktop-launcher-testing branch with all new changes
git push origin desktop-launcher-testing
```

This uploads all your v1.0.0 work to GitHub on the feature branch.

### Step 2: Merge to Main Branch (Recommended Approach)

You have several options for merging. Here's the cleanest approach:

#### Option A: Merge via GitHub (Recommended)
1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com/erleaus/obsidian-GUI-tool
2. **Create Pull Request**: Click "Compare & pull request" for `desktop-launcher-testing`
3. **Fill PR Details**:
   ```
   Title: 🎉 v1.0.0 - Professional DMG Packaging & Production Release
   
   Description:
   Major release with professional macOS packaging and streamlined codebase.
   
   ## 🌟 What's New
   - Professional DMG packaging system (~160MB)
   - Self-contained macOS app with drag-to-install interface
   - Comprehensive build documentation and guides
   - Streamlined codebase (removed experimental features)
   - Enhanced settings and improved stability
   
   ## 📦 Key Files
   - `build_dmg_simple.sh` - One-command DMG builder
   - `DMG_BUILD_GUIDE.md` - Complete build documentation
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed version history
   - `Obsidian_Checker_v1.0.0.dmg` - Ready-to-distribute package
   
   ## 🧪 Testing
   - ✅ DMG builds successfully
   - ✅ App launches and runs correctly
   - ✅ All core features working
   - ✅ Settings dialog functional
   
   Ready for production use and distribution.
   ```
4. **Review Changes**: GitHub will show all files changed
5. **Merge**: Click "Merge pull request" → "Confirm merge"
6. **Delete Branch**: Optionally delete the feature branch after merging

#### Option B: Local Merge (Advanced)
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge desktop-launcher-testing into main
git merge desktop-launcher-testing

# Push merged main branch
git push origin main

# Optional: Delete the feature branch
git branch -d desktop-launcher-testing
git push origin --delete desktop-launcher-testing
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release

After merging to main:

1. **Go to Releases**: Visit https://github.com/erleaus/obsidian-GUI-tool/releases
2. **Create New Release**: Click "Create a new release"
3. **Tag Details**:
   ```
   Tag: v1.0.0
   Title: 🎉 Obsidian Checker v1.0.0 - Professional DMG Release
   Target: main (after merge)
   ```
4. **Release Description**: Copy from `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md`
5. **Upload DMG**: Attach `Obsidian_Checker_v1.0.0.dmg` as release asset
6. **Publish**: Mark as latest release

## 📋 Complete Commands Sequence

Here's the complete sequence to execute:

```bash
# 1. Push current branch
git push origin desktop-launcher-testing

# 2. Switch to main and merge (if doing local merge)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge desktop-launcher-testing

# 3. Push main branch
git push origin main

# 4. Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0 - Professional DMG packaging release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# 5. Clean up (optional)
git branch -d desktop-launcher-testing
git push origin --delete desktop-launcher-testing
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After pushing and merging:

### ✅ Check GitHub Repository
- [ ] All new files visible on main branch
- [ ] `README.md` shows updated information
- [ ] `DMG_BUILD_GUIDE.md` and other docs accessible
- [ ] DMG file uploaded as release asset

### ✅ Test Download and Installation
- [ ] Download DMG from GitHub release
- [ ] Install on clean Mac (if possible)
- [ ] Verify app launches correctly
- [ ] Test core functionality

### ✅ Documentation Verification
- [ ] README links work correctly
- [ ] Build guide is accessible and accurate
- [ ] Release notes display properly
- [ ] CHANGELOG renders correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Large File Issues
If Git complains about the DMG file size:

```bash
# Check file size
ls -lh Obsidian_Checker_v1.0.0.dmg

# If >100MB, consider Git LFS (Large File Storage)
git lfs track "*.dmg"
git add .gitattributes
git add Obsidian_Checker_v1.0.0.dmg
git commit -m "Add DMG with Git LFS"
```

### Merge Conflicts
If you encounter merge conflicts:

```bash
# Check conflict status
git status

# Resolve conflicts in files, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Push Rejected
If push is rejected due to remote changes:

```bash
# Fetch and rebase
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Force push if necessary (use cautiously)
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

## 🏷️ Release Tags and Versioning

### Semantic Versioning
- `v1.0.0` = Major release (breaking changes, new features)
- `v1.0.1` = Patch release (bug fixes)
- `v1.1.0` = Minor release (new features, backward compatible)

### Tag Management
```bash
# List all tags
git tag -l

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release with DMG packaging"

# Push specific tag
git push origin v1.0.0

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags

# Delete tag (if needed)
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```
